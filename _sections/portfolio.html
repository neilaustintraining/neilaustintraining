<p>“I hired Neil because I was looking to get strong and buff like him. My results have been wonderful I have gotten a lot stronger which 
 gave me a lot more self-confidence which keeps me coming back every time. I would highly recommend Neil Austin's services as a 
 personal trainer even if you're not looking to get buff because he is very interested in helping people and he is a very friendly person 
 to associate with which is half the reason I keep going back to the gym.”</p>

<p>"I hired Neil after getting fed up with a long period of being in bad shape and often sick. I have been working with him for a year and 
my results have been amazing.  I've never been stronger, I've lost fat and gained a lot of muscle.  I could barely lift the bar for bench 
press and can now do 120lb and I just hit 410 on the leg press. Neil knows exactly how to motivate me and puts together challenging 
programs for me. I don't hide from the camera anymore and it's great to wear tank tops without being selfish conscious.”</p>

<p>“Neil Austin.  Partially irritated but with an open mind is how I met Neil, my former trainer had abruptly quit.
However, we quickly established a great working relationship that continues after over 2 years.
This guy pushes me way harder than I can or would, ever push myself.  I would absolutely recommend
calling for an appt. with Neil, he is knowledgable and attentive and can skillfully tailor a workout 
 that will work for you & help you achieve your goals.”</p>
