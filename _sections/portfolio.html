"One of a kind!

As a chiropractor and  rehab specialist Neil is my go to guy when I need 
to refer my patients for training.  His knowledge as a trainer, passion 
for helping people and skill set to progress people to reach their 
goals, is unparalleled.  He takes the time to get to know you and what 
you are looking for, rather than a cookie cutter template.  He is a 
master at his craft and I couldn't recommend him more.

Also, as a bonus he is a super likeable guy!"

“I hired Neil because I was looking to get strong and buff like him. 
My results have been wonderful I have gotten a lot stronger which gave me a lot more self-confidence 
which keeps me coming back every time. I would highly recommend Neil Austin's services as a personal trainer."

“I hired Neil after getting fed up with a long period of being in bad shape and often sick. 
I knew I wouldn't do well unless my routine included weight training. From his profile information I knew Neil would be a good fit. 
I have been working with him for a year and my results have been amazing.  I've never been stronger, 
I've lost fat and gained a lot of muscle.  I could barely lift the bar for bench press and can now do 120lb 
and I just hit 410 on the leg press. Neil knows exactly how to motivate me and puts together challenging programs for me. 
I don't hide from the camera anymore and it's great to wear tank tops without being selfish conscious.”
