<p>“I hired Neil because I was looking to get strong and buff like him. My results have been wonderful I have gotten a lot stronger which 
 gave me a lot more self-confidence which keeps me coming back every time. I would highly recommend Neil Austin's services as a 
 personal trainer even if you're not looking to get buff because he is very interested in helping people and he is a very friendly person 
 to associate with which is half the reason I keep going back to the gym.”</p>
