"One of a kind!

As a chiropractor and  rehab specialist Neil is my go to guy when I need 
to refer my patients for training.  His knowledge as a trainer, passion 
for helping people and skill set to progress people to reach their 
goals, is unparalleled.  He takes the time to get to know you and what 
you are looking for, rather than a cookie cutter template.  He is a 
master at his craft and I couldn't recommend him more.

Also, as a bonus he is a super likeable guy!"
- Zach Greenwade, Chiropactor/Rehab Specialist
