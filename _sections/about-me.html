<p>My name is Neil Austin, certified No BS Fitness Professional.
   The thing that got me started on the crazy journey that's led me here was graduating High School at 135lbs soaking wet. Not exactly your starting quarterback. 
   I realized I needed to make a big change, and guess what. I did it. Day after day after day of hard work and consistency finally paid off.
   Along the way I discovered my passion for helping other people get the same kind of big results. That led me to personal training and to a big box
   corporate-owned gym, where I trained an eclectic lineup of clients that ranged from high school athletes to people recovering from
   MS, brain aneurysms, and parkinsons. 
   I loved my clients and everything about my job except for one very disturbing thing. Everywhere I looked, I saw people being manipulated.
   Everywhere I looked, I saw people being harrassed and sold to and treated like just another dollar sign.
   Basically, I saw I whole bunch of BS.
   Fast forward to today: I am an independent trainer and business owner dedicated to cutting through all the BS that's out there in order
   to help people truly change their lives. My mission is simple. Get rid of the BS, and teach people what actually works.</p>
