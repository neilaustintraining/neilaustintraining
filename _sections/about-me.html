<p>My name is Neil Austin, certified No BS Fitness Professional. This is a test.</p>
   
<p>The thing that got me started on the crazy journey that's led me here was graduating High School at 135lbs soaking wet. Not exactly your starting quarterback.</p>
   
<p>I realized I needed to make a big change, and guess what. I did it. Day after day after day of hard work and consistency finally paid off.</p>
   
<p>Along the way I discovered my passion for helping other people get the same kind of big results. That led me to personal training and to a big box
corporate-owned gym, where I trained an eclectic lineup of clients that ranged from high school athletes to people recovering from
MS, brain aneurysms, and parkinsons.</p>
   
<p>I loved my clients and everything about my job except for one very disturbing thing. Everywhere I looked, I saw people being manipulated.</p>
   
<p>Everywhere I looked, I saw people being harrassed and sold to and treated like just another dollar sign.</p>
  
<p>Basically, I saw a whole bunch of BS.</p>
  
<p>Fast forward to today: I am an independent trainer and business owner dedicated to cutting through all the BS that's out there in order
to help people truly change their lives.</p>
   
<p>My mission is simple. Get rid of the BS, and teach people what actually works.</p>
